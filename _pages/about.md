I am a second-year doctoral student in the [Department of Statistics and Data Sceinces](https://stat.utexas.edu/) at the Univesity of Texas at Austin, where I am jointly advised by [Alessandro Rinaldo](https://arinaldo.github.io/) and [Purnamrita Sarkar](https://psarkar.github.io/). My research focuses on the intersection of high-dimensional statistics and deep learning, with an interest in developing computationally efficient sampling algorithms and applying them to statiscal inference problems, uncertainty quantification and fairness.

Previously, I completed my bachelor's degree in the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.iitk.ac.in/) at the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, where I had the privelege to be advised by [Dootika Vats](https://dvats.github.io/). I also had the opportunity to work with the amazing [Piyush Rai](https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/piyush/), [Vipul Arora](https://vipular.github.io/) and [Ashutosh Modi](https://ashutosh-modi.github.io/).

Beyond work, I am an Indian classical vocalist and I enjoy going for hikes. 

PS: I'd try my best to give advice and feedback for those who are applying to graduate programs in statistics, machhine learning or related fields, particularly to those for whom this type of feedback would usually be unavailable. The best way to reach out to me is by email.
